# üõ°Ô∏è DuckyFence ‚Äî RP2040-Based BadUSB Defense Board

**DuckyFence** is a custom-built USB defense board powered by the RP2040. It helps detect and log suspicious USB devices ‚Äî especially ones that act like keyboards (like Rubber Ducky or other BadUSB-style HID injectors). This board sits between the attacker and your system, giving you real-time visibility into USB activity before it‚Äôs too late.

It‚Äôs built for makers, researchers, and defenders who want a simple, low-cost, and reliable way to catch malicious USB behavior.

- USB-A port to plug in potentially malicious devices
- USB-C port for 5V input + UART communication
- AMS1117-3.3V regulator for stable onboard power
- UART header for connecting to Arduino or USB-Serial adapter
- Breakout for GPIO2‚Äì9 to use for LEDs, buzzers, or expansion
- SWD header for debugging with external programmer
- BOOTSEL jumper and a physical RUN button
- Minimal, well-labeled design with clean silkscreen layout

## üß± How It Works

```plaintext
[ USB-A ] ‚Üê Suspicious USB device
     ‚Üì
[ RP2040 ] ‚Äî Parses descriptors or monitors keypresses
     ‚Üì
[ UART Header ] ‚Äî Connects to Arduino or USB-to-Serial
     ‚Üì
[ Host Computer ] ‚Äî Displays or logs data using Python tools
````

The board inspects what's plugged into the USB-A port and passes logs via UART to your Arduino or PC for alerting and analysis.

Absolutely! Here's a clean, concise, and human-friendly **NeoPixel section** for your `README.md`. You can paste this right under your **Python Tools** section:

## üåà NeoPixel Status Indicator

DuckyFence includes support for a **single WS2812 NeoPixel RGB LED** as a visual status indicator. It gives instant feedback about USB device activity ‚Äî even without a serial monitor.

### üéØ Behavior

| Color     | Meaning                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| üü° Yellow | No USB device connected            |
| üü¢ Green  | Safe device detected (not flagged) |
| üî¥ Red    | BadUSB or known malicious VID/PID  |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

* **GPIO3** is used to control the NeoPixel
* Connect VCC to **3.3V**, GND to **GND**, and **DIN** to GPIO3
* Add a **330Œ© resistor** in series with DIN
* Add a **100‚ÄØ¬µF capacitor** across VCC‚ÄìGND for stability

### üìÅ Firmware File

The NeoPixel logic lives in:

* `firmware/usb_neopixel_status.c`
* Uses PIO + `ws2812.pio` for smooth color control
* Integrated with `usb_filter.c` to reflect detection events in real time

This makes the board fully usable even without any UART or PC connection ‚Äî just power it up, plug in a USB device, and watch the LED show the result.
